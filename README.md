# Jarvis - Dana's Personal Assistant

Jarvis is a personal assistant project currently in development, designed to help Dana with various tasks through voice commands. Built using Python, Jarvis leverages speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries to interact with the user. The assistant can perform tasks such as opening websites, launching applications, and engaging in simple conversations, making it a versatile tool for everyday use.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Jarvis uses the `speech_recognition` library to convert spoken words into text, allowing for seamless voice commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: The `pyttsx3` library enables Jarvis to respond to the user with spoken words, creating a more interactive experience.
- **Web Browsing**: Jarvis can open popular websites like YouTube, Spotify, and Instagram based on user commands.
- **Application Launching**: The assistant can launch applications on the user's system, making it easier to access frequently used programs.
- **Conversational Interaction**: Jarvis can engage in simple conversations, such as greeting the user by name or responding to age-related comments.
