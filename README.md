# Jarvis - Dana's Personal Assistant

Jarvis is a personal assistant project currently in development, designed to help Dana with various tasks through voice commands. Built using Python, Jarvis leverages speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries to interact with the user. The assistant can perform tasks such as opening websites, launching applications, and engaging in simple conversations, making it a versatile tool for everyday use.

## Features

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li><strong>Speech Recognition</strong>: Jarvis uses the <code>speech_recognition</code> library to convert spoken words into text, allowing for seamless voice commands.</li>
  <li><strong>Text-to-Speech</strong>: The <code>pyttsx3</code> library enables Jarvis to respond to the user with spoken words, creating a more interactive experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Web Browsing</strong>: Jarvis can open popular websites like YouTube, Spotify, and Instagram based on user commands.</li>
  <li><strong>Application Launching</strong>: The assistant can launch applications on the user's system, making it easier to access frequently used programs.</li>
  <li><strong>Conversational Interaction</strong>: Jarvis can engage in simple conversations, such as greeting the user by name or responding to age-related comments.</li>
</ul>

## Code Overview

The project consists of two main Python scripts:

1. **CHATGPTVA.py**: This script handles the core functionality of Jarvis, including speech-to-text conversion, interaction with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, and text-to-speech responses. It continuously listens for user input and provides responses using the GPT model.

2. **speech_to_text.py**: This script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for Jarvis, built using the <code>tkinter</code> library. It allows the user to interact with Jarvis through a chat-like interface, where both user inputs and Jarvis's responses are displayed. The script also includes functionality for opening websites and applications based on voice commands.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with More APIs**: Future versions of Jarvis could integrate with additional APIs to provide more functionalities, such as weather updates, news briefings, and calendar management.
- **Improved Natural Language Processing**: Enhancing the natural language processing capabilities of Jarvis could make interactions more fluid and intuitive.
- **Custom Commands**: Allowing users to define custom commands could make Jarvis even more personalized and useful for specific tasks.

> Jarvis is an ongoing project with the potential to become a powerful and personalized assistant, tailored to Dana's needs and preferences.
