# Jarvis - Dana's Personal Assistant

Jarvis is a personal assistant project currently in development, designed to help Dana with various tasks through voice commands. Built using Python, Jarvis leverages speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries to interact with the user. The assistant can perform tasks such as opening websites, launching applications, and engaging in simple conversations, making it a versatile tool for everyday use.
